<h1>Abstract</h1>
Retail businesses generate a large volume of sales data daily, but most traditional
systems only record transactions without providing intelligent insights. This project,
Retail Store Sales Prediction, aims to develop a smart web‑based application using
ASP.NET MVC that predicts future sales based on historical data. The system collects
and stores daily sales information such as product category, quantity sold, pricing,
seasonal trends, and promotional events. A prediction engine uses trained machine
learning models to generate accurate sales forecasts, which help retail managers plan
inventory, manage stock levels, and optimize purchasing decisions to reduce losses
and maximize revenue.
The application consists of three core modules: (1) Data Management Module for
entry and storage of historical sales records, (2) Prediction Engine that applies
forecasting models to generate future sales values, and (3) User Interface built on
ASP.NET MVC that provides interactive dashboards, charts, and reports for easy
interpretation of predicted results. The project demonstrates how structured data,
statistical models, and a user‑friendly web interface can be integrated to support
data‑driven decision‑making in retail environments.

<h1>Background</h1> 
Retail stores deal with a large number of transactions every day. Traditional retail
systems mainly focus on recording sales, managing inventory, and generating basic
reports. However, they often lack the capability to analyze historical data and predict
future sales trends. This limitation makes it difficult for store managers to plan stock
levels, manage inventory, and decide on promotional strategies effectively.
With the availability of historical sales data, modern machine learning techniques can
be applied to forecast future demand. By integrating these predictions into a
web‑based application, retailers can make informed decisions, reduce overstocking
and understocking, and improve overall profitability.

<h1>Problem Statement</h1> 
Most small and medium retail businesses do not have access to intelligent sales
forecasting tools. They rely on manual judgment or simple spreadsheets, which are
time‑consuming and error‑prone. There is a need for an easy‑to‑use, web‑based
system that can ingest historical sales data, apply forecasting models, and present
predictions in a clear and interactive manner.

<h1>Objectives of the Project</h1> 
• To design and develop an ASP.NET MVC web application for retail store sales
prediction.
• To implement a data management module for uploading and storing historical
sales records.
• To build a prediction engine that generates future sales forecasts using trained
models.
• To create an interactive user interface with dashboards, charts, and reports for
visualizing predictions.
• To validate the system through testing and compare predicted values with actual
sales data

<h1>Scope of the Project</h1>
• The system supports daily or periodic sales data entry and upload.
• It handles attributes such as product category, quantity sold, price, date, and
promotional events.
• The prediction engine focuses on short‑term sales forecasting (e.g., next 7–30
days).
• The web interface is accessible through a browser and does not require
installation of additional software.

<h1>Technology Stack</h1>
• Frontend: ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Charting library (e.g.,
Chart.js or similar)
• Backend: C#, .NET Framework / .NET Core
• Database: JSON Data
